## Offer, Acceptance and Conclusion of Contract

The contract is concluded exclusively via the booking portal on the website of Contractor. By registering via this booking portal, the Customer submits a binding offer.

If an offer by the Customer is made by e-mail or similar means, a contract shall likewise only come into existence upon written confirmation by Contractor.

Within the scope of the confirmation e-mail, the Customer shall receive the essential contents of the Course registration and his personal data as stored in the system.

Contractor reserves the right to cancel or terminate the course up to one week prior to the start of the course after exhausting all possibilities if this is not reasonable because the booking volume for this course is so low that the costs incurred in relation to this course would mean exceeding the economic sacrifice limit. In the event of cancellation by Contractor, the Customer shall receive a full refund and payment of the Course Fee.

## Contract duration and payment conditions

The contract begins at the specific and individually agreed time. A postponement is only possible with the settled agreement of all Customers and the corresponding instructors.

The full course fee is due upon course registration. Unless expressly agreed otherwise, the Customer will receive an invoice shortly after registration, which must be credited to Contractor's bank account no later than 10 days prior to the start of the Course. All invoices have a maximum payment term of 10 days.

The course fees include course fees, training documents, examination fees and, if the examination is passed, a corresponding proof in the form of a certificate. Costs for replacement certificates resulting from incorrect information (including spelling mistakes) provided during registration are to be borne by the Customer.

Complete rental equipment - if necessary, for the course - will be provided by Contractor free of charge for the duration of the course. This refers to special equipment for the respective training modules. In principle, the Customer must bring his/her own work clothing, safety shoes, safety helmet and work gloves.

If the payment dates are exceeded, Contractor shall be entitled to default interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above the applicable base interest rate of the EZV without further reminder. The right to claim damages in excess thereof shall remain unaffected.

In addition, the Customer receives an entry in his safety logbook. If no safety logbook is available, we will be happy to issue one.

## Services not used

The specified course dates are binding and must be adhered to by the Customer. Fixed and unattended dates - regardless of the reason and in case of illness of the Customer - can only be made up for an additional fee and after consultation and availability.

The one-time or repeated non-charging of additional units of any kind whatsoever is purely an act of goodwill on the part of Contractor and does not imply any future claim on the part of the Customer or any amendment to the contract.

If the Customer cancels or fails to attend the Course - for whatever reason and also in the event of illness of the Customer - Contractor's claim to the Course Fee shall remain in full.
