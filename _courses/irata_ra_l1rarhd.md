If you are IRATA level 1 and haven't climbed for 6-12 months then you can attend this half day refresh training. If you havenâ€™t climbed for more than 12 months you need to attend the full day refresh training instead.

If you an IRATA technician and working in Germany you need to refresh your training every 12 months according to DGUV regulation and you need to attend the full day course instead.
